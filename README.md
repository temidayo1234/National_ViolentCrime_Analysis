Members: Temidayo Akinsanya and Cheryl Johnson

Project Description: This project will seek to examine all cities in all states in the United States and extract and compare the cities in each state that has the highest and lowest crime rate per capita.

Research Questions:
Is there a correlation between the level of violent crime and income?
Is there a correlation between the level of violent crime and unemployment?
Can the rate of school enrollment predict the level of violent crime rate in America cities?
Is violent crime rate more likely to be higher in cities with a particular race or higher population?
